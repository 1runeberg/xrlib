 C++20 OpenXR wrapper library designed to abstract the complexities of the OpenXR API while retaining its flexibility, allowing developers to focus on creating immersive experiences without getting bogged down by low-level details. The library is Vulkan-native and includes an optional PBR renderer, designed from the ground up with mixed reality in mind.

 ## Note
 This repository currently hosts a simplified version of an internal, comprehensive rewrite of [OpenXRProvider_v2](https://github.com/1runeberg/OpenXRProvider_v2).

The internal library is significantly more advanced but is still in active development as the rewrite is in conjunction with development of a full-featured mixed reality application, scheduled for release by [Beyond Reality Labs](https://beyondreality.io). To avoid backward-incompatible changes, only the most stable components of the rewritten library are made available here.
